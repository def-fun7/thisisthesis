      <p>two rather unseen seekers were looking for something theoretically ideal and physically improbable. A black hole. But not any run-of-a-fusion-fuel-black-hole. But a very specific one and the most simplest one. A black hole that doesn't spin nor have any charge. An ideal static, stationary Schwarzschild Black hole. For anyone who knew any physics, knew one thing, everything from the microscropic quarks to the macroscopic quasars were spinning.</p>
      <p>Knowing this, they didn't look for their model black hole in their universe but at the odd metaphorical corners and trenches of the multiverse. If looking for such an ideal entity wasn't their search parameters also included more filter. That being,</p>
      <p>"thou mass shalt be three. No more. No less. Three shall be the magnitude of thy mass, and the magnitude of thy mass shall be three. Four shalt not be thine mass, neither mass of two, excepting that thou then had a mass of three. one is right out."</p>
      <p>with pun intended, their strict code of mass, along with the rest of the aforementioned criteria, their search was like trying to catch a white cat in a brightly lit white room with having no one in there and the cat being the notorious schwardinger's cat.</p>
      <p>But against all odd, in an oddly universe where nature seem to have given up on logical and seem to have run out of math, the find the exact black hole they were looking.</p>
      <p>with all the marks checked, looking at the screen of there researchplay, umiko and faya was ecastic.</p>
