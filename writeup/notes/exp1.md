# Experiment No. 01

The question we are asking, if you still don't know, is, **How a conversation near the end of spacetime is really like?**

To simplify things,

- A conversation is exchange of messages in terms of light rays (EM radiation).
- End of spacetime is the Event Horizon.

Yes, Black holes, baby!!!

## Schwarzschild Black Hole $(SBH)$

For the first experiment, we will use the simplest of black hole, $SBH$, with angular momentum $(J)$ and charge $(Q)$ both zero, having only a static symmetrical Black Hole with mass $(M)$.

### Schwarzschild radius $(r_s)$


$$ r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} \tag{1.1}$$

where, $ 2G/c^2$ is a constant equals to $1.485 \times 10^{-27} kg^{-1}m$ or $2953.2501 M\odot^{-1}m$, so, letting

$$ \chi_{rs} = 2953.2501 M\odot^{-1}m $$
giving us,

$$ r_s = \chi_{rs} M \tag{1.2}$$
where, $M$ is in the units of Solar mass.

This gives us the following relation,

$$ r_s \propto M \tag{r1}$$

That's all we need to define our black hole for now.

## Participants

For this experiment we have two participant, minimum for a conversation between people.

1. Jessie
2. Jules

The most basic things, parameters, in spacetime are,

1. Distance
2. Time

But here is a catch, in GR, we have two distinct kind of time (or distance and every other parameter too actually), namely for start up we will use,

- Proper time
- Coordinate time
- Proper distance
- Coordinate distance

where, proper means the quantity measured by the observers in their own frame of reference and coordinate ones are the measurement based on a coordinate system and not really the physical things themselves.

The most difficult thing about this experiments is that there are infinite variations of it (simply consider $M$ which can be any $\Re$ and $\Re$ set is infinite), considering different parameters and everything. So, the main efforts are in deciding what not to include and how to bottle things down.

``` 
Simple maths, four quantities per person, for two person we get 8 quantities. Let's condense them.
```

### Jessie

Jessie is the one near the edge of the event horizon of $SBH$. As gravitational field is strongest there, the warping of spacetime is most pronounce as compare to Jules, meaning Proper and coordinate distance, as well as time, vary. Their relation is given by,


$$ \Delta r' = \frac {\Delta r}{\sqrt {1-\frac{r_s}{r}}} \tag{2.1}$$

$$ \tau  = t\sqrt {1-\frac{r_s}{r}} \tag{2.2}$$

we let the factor $\sqrt{1-\frac{r_s}{r}}$ as $q$ to simplify equations,


$$ \Delta r' = \Delta r \cdot \frac{1}{q} \tag{2.3}$$

$$ \tau  = t\cdot q\tag{2.4}$$

where $r$ is known as radial distance and defined as the coordinate distance from the center of a black hole to the observer and is equal to,

$$ r = \Delta r + r_s \tag{2.5}$$
where, $\Delta r$ is the distance from the event horizon to the observer.

Now, we will define only $\Delta r$ for Jessie and calculate proper distance $\Delta r'$ (or vice versa). For time, the coordinate time will be same as Jules.

Other than that, We will have these further physical parameters defined for Jessie,

- Relativistic (or Proper) acceleration
- Gravitational Redshift
- Observed wavelength
- Tidal forces

The formulas for these are,

$$ g = \frac{GM}{r^2\sqrt{1 - \frac{r_s}{r}}} \tag{2.6}$$


$$ z = \frac {1} {\sqrt {1 - \frac {r_s}{r}}} - 1 \tag{2.7}$$

$$ 位_{o} = (z 路 位_{e}) + 位_{e} \tag{2.8}$$

$$ \Delta g = \frac{2GMd}{r^3} \tag{2.9} $$

$$ g = \frac{GM}{r^2}\cdot \frac{1}{q}\tag{2.10}$$

$$ z = \frac {1} {q} - 1 \tag{2.11}$$

### Jules

Unlike, Jessie, Jules is way off from the $SBH$ and so her coordinate time and distance is same as her proper (as $r$ increases, the ratio decreases so the effect of the whole term diminishes, giving us the same Newtonian formulas back).

Her coordinate time, or the way her clocks measure time will also be used to calculate how times is moving for Jessie.

Beside that, her distance from Black hole can be any number, like Jessie's $\Delta r$, however, as we change the mass of our $SBH$, the $r_s$ will change meaning the ratio will change, meaning a constant distance $(d)$ say a light year for Jules will not mean same thing for different mass values. hence, we will fix the value of acceleration $a$ due to the $SBH$ and calculate $d$ accordingly using,

$$ d = \sqrt {\frac{GM}{a}} \tag{2.12}$$

Her distance then to Jules is given by

$$ \Delta d = d - r \tag{2.13}$$

## Scenario

Jessie is hovering at a distance (radial distance) $``r"$ from a $SBH$ with a mass $``M"$ that has a schwarzschild radius $``r_s''$. The coordinate distance of Jessie from the Event Horizon is $``\Delta r"$ and her proper distance to the event horizon (the distance she will measure with any measuring instrument herself) is $``\Delta r'"$. The time her clock measures is her proper time $``\tau"$. The acceleration she experience there (and must counteract in order to hozer there) is $``g"$, while the tidal acceleration or gradient of $g$ is given by $``\Delta g"$.

Jules is at a distance $``d"$ from the $SBH$ where she experience the acceleration $a$ due to gravity (in newtonian sense). Her coordinate time $``t"$ and proper time is same.

### Simple case

(let's start the conversation)

- They will communicate using morse code.

- The $\cdot$ will be represented by a 3 second flash and $-$ will be represented by a 7 second flash.

- Jessie will use green light while Jules will use red light.

because of the $SBH$,

- Jessie signal will be redshifted, from green to far infrared or up to even radio.
- Jules signal will be blueshifted, from red to soft UVs or even X-ray
- Jessie ``3 seconds" or $\cdot$ signal can be minutes long or even days.
- Jules ``3 seconds" or $\cdot$ signal can be nanoseconds.

we have to set the quantities, or rearrange formulas, so that, observed signal properties remain same for both parties.

Meaning we, will be figuring out the details of the parameters their signal must have.

```
Infinite choices. 

Here is a funny twist, (we'll prove that later with equations), if you focus on equations, they give you a interesting insight. 

The BHs with high mass have weaker tidal forces (meaning they are tolerable) i.e. no spaghettification, but they also have strong gravitational field, meaning a lot more time dilation and redshift. 

so, let's say, for conceptual purposes, with a 1 solar mass BH, one second of coordinate time at one meter distance is "0.0184 sec", it is "0.000184 sec" for a 1000 solar mass BH, meaning time is more slower around a more massive BH. but, for the tidal forces, for one solar mass is billions of ge while for 5000 solar mass, it's 2 or three times of ge (ge = 9.98). 

we need to find an ideal set of parameter for our BH, or where most things are as good as they can be.
